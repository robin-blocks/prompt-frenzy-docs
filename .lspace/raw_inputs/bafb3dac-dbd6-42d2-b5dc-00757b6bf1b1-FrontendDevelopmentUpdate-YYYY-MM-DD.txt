# Frontend Development Update - YYYY-MM-DD

This document outlines recent significant developments and changes made to the Prompt Frenzy frontend application.

## Key Updates:

1.  **Git Repository Initialization:**
    *   The frontend project codebase has been initialized as a Git repository.
    *   An initial commit was made, including all existing project files and a new `README.md` with setup instructions.

2.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Addressed and resolved `npm install` failures related to `date-fns` peer dependency conflicts by successfully using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

3.  **Client-Side Search Feature:**
    *   A search functionality has been implemented directly within the frontend.
    *   Users can now utilize the search bar located in the header to filter the list of displayed prompts.
    *   The search operates in real-time, filtering based on matching terms in prompt titles and content.

4.  **Data Fetching Robustness:**
    *   The core data fetching mechanism in `app/page.tsx` (responsible for loading prompts) has been significantly enhanced.
    *   Implemented an `isActive` flag within the data fetching `useEffect` hook to prevent state updates from stale asynchronous calls, particularly addressing issues with page refreshes and component lifecycle changes.
    *   Introduced a `refetchIndex` state variable to enable controlled and reliable data refetching, for instance, after a user votes on a prompt.

5.  **Vercel Deployment Preparation:**
    *   The Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) was installed globally (`npm i -g vercel`).
    *   The initial Vercel deployment process was started using the `vercel` command. 
    *   The next steps involve completing the Vercel project setup, which includes linking the local Git repository to a remote provider (e.g., GitHub) and configuring essential environment variables (specifically `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) within the Vercel project settings.

This update marks significant progress in stabilizing the frontend application, enhancing its features, and preparing it for cloud deployment.
